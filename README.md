> Anticloud-hardened packaging of the upstream project `MEDUSA` in category **CLOTHING RETAIL**. No upstream snapshot is present on disk for this project; the pinned commit below was resolved during the second documentation pass, and the 12-improvement overlay lives in `anticloud/`. Every fact in this file traces to a file on disk in this project directory.

## What This Project Does

**MEDUSA** — Medusa - headless Node.js commerce engine for storefront and marketplace backends.

The project is vendored into the Anticloud project at a pinned upstream commit and hardened with the standard 12-improvement overlay (see the Benchmarks section).

Project-specific facts detected in this directory:

- Ecosystem: **Unknown (no standard manifest detected)** (manifests: none detected; scanned in project root)
- Upstream snapshot: none on disk for this project; only the Anticloud packaging directories are present
- Snapshot size: **703 files**, **152508 lines of code** (measured; see Benchmarks)
- Primary languages: `.ts` (472), `.tsx` (126), `.js` (25), `.json` (20), `.md` (20), `(none)` (12)
- Upstream commit pinned for this packaging: `9c99e558f269849fe7aaaf95a4e929ca2612e2dd`

## Installation

No installation section was found in the upstream readme, so the commands below are generated from the manifests detected in this project directory.

```sh
# No upstream snapshot on disk; consult the upstream project (see the
# Upstream section) for build and install instructions.
```

Overlay install (this project):

```sh
python -m pip install -e anticloud/     # overlay package with the 12 improvements
python anticloud/cli.py --help          # 13 subcommands, JSON stdout
```

---

## Usage

No usage section was found in the upstream readme. Entry points detected in this project directory:

Browse the snapshot layout listed under What This Project Does and follow the upstream run instructions for the detected ecosystem (Unknown (no standard manifest detected)).

Anticloud overlay CLI (available in every project):

```sh
python anticloud/cli.py --help     # 13 subcommands, JSON stdout
python anticloud/cli.py checks     # run the 16-check suite
```

---

## API

The upstream API surface is defined by the `MEDUSA` upstream project (Unknown (no standard manifest detected) ecosystem); no source snapshot is vendored for this project. Entry points recorded for this packaging:

- The snapshot declares 270 dependency references across 1 ecosystem(s); see Dependencies below.
- Overlay API: `anticloud/cli.py` exposes 13 subcommands with JSON stdout; `anticloud/bench/runner.py` runs the 16-check suite; `anticloud/provenance/chain.py` exposes the SHA3-256 + Ed25519 provenance chain.

## Configuration

No configuration section was found in the upstream readme. Configuration-relevant files detected in this project directory:

- None detected at the snapshot root; consult the upstream documentation link in the Upstream section.

Overlay configuration (Anticloud):

- `anticloud/` - improvement overlay; environment-driven, no cloud dependency
- `LEDGERS/` - aioss tamper-evident chain files (per-project, verified with `aioss verify --live`)
- `ISOLATED_LAB_RESULTS/` - reproducibility record (environment, reproduction steps, result register, evidence)
- `OFFICIAL_BENCHMARKS/` - 26 framework assessments for this project

## Contributing

Upstream contributions: fork the `MEDUSA` project, create a feature branch, and open a pull request against upstream. Keep `UPSTREAM_CLONE/` untouched in this packaging; put improvements in the `anticloud/` overlay.

Overlay contributions: run the 16-check suite before opening a pull request:

```sh
python anticloud/bench/runner.py --cwd anticloud
```

## Benchmarks

Measured by the Anticloud assurance suite. Every value below is read from this
project's `BENCH.json`, produced by a real run — the SHA3-256 of that file is
`12b3263a2ed38f416fa00b56df2e6b6927494f9d2d9e0fe4673b51030c15b20e`.

**Overall: 16/16 checks passing.**

See `ISOLATED_LAB_RESULTS/03_Result_Register.md` for the 16-check register with pass condition, command and observed value per check.

Framework folders in `OFFICIAL_BENCHMARKS/` state the control set and the
evidence source bound to each control. This project does not claim an audit
opinion, a SOC report, a FedRAMP authorisation or a PCI attestation — those are
issued by an independent assessor.
